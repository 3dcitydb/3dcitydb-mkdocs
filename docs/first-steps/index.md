This quickstart guide gives step-by-step instructions for setting up a 3D City Database instance and CityDB tools. Installers for the 3D City Database components can be downloaded from the [official release website](https://github.com/3dcitydb/3dcitydb-suite/releases) or from the [project website](https://www.3dcitydb.org/3dcitydb/downloads/).  The source code of the 3D City Database is hosted and maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/3dcitydb).

- [Setting up the 3DCityDB schema](setup.md)
- [Migration from previous releases](3dcitydb.md)
- [CityDB tools](citydb-tool.md)
- [Docker Images](docker.md)

The individual components of the 3D City Database are also available as images for the Docker virtualization technology. This makes it possible to install and configure a 3D City Database with a single command line statement in almost any runtime environment. See Section [Docker](docker.md) for more details.
