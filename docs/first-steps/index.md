This quickstart guide gives step-by-step instructions for setting up a 3D City Database instance and the database client
citydb-tool. Follow the [download instructions](../download.md) to obtain the required software packages. The source
code of the 3D City Database is hosted and maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/3dcitydb){target="blank"}.

- [System requirements](requirements.md)
- [Setting up the 3DCityDB schema](setup.md)
- [Using the citydb-tool](citydb-tool.md)
- [Using Docker to run a 3DCityDB and the citydb-tool](docker.md)
- [Migration from previous releases](migration.md)

The individual components of the 3D City Database are also available as images for the Docker virtualization technology.
This makes it possible to install and configure a 3D City Database with a single command line statement in almost any
runtime environment. See Section [Docker](docker.md) for more details.
