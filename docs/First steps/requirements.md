# Requirements
Setting up an instance of the 3D City Database requires an existing installation of a PostgreSQL.

# PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension
Supported versions are PostgreSQL 11 and higher with PostGIS 2.5 and higher. Make sure to check the PostgreSQL versioning policy to find out which PostgreSQL are actively maintained or have reached end-of-life. The PostGIS support matrix shows which versions of PostgreSQL are supported by which versions of PostGIS and whether a specific PostGIS version has reached end-of-life.
