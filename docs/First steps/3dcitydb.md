# 3DCityDB
The 3D City Database serves as a central data management component for 3D city models. It enables the consistent storage of 3D geodata content, enabling long-term viability of the data. It includes a relational database schema for implementing a CityGML-compliant database on top of a database management system (DBMS), a Java-based database client for data import and export. Currently, the most advanced open-source PostgreSQL/PostGIS geodatabase systems is supported.
