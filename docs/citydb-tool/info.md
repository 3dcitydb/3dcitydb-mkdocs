The `info` command generates a comprehensive summary of a 3DCityDB `v5` instance, providing key details about the data
sored in the database, including available feature types, Levels of Detail (LoDs), feature and geometry counts, appearance
information, generic attributes, the spatial extent of all features, and database metadata such as the coordinate
reference system (CRS).

By default, the command prints a human-readable report to the console, but the same information can also be output in
JSON format for automated workflows or programmatic use.

## Synopsis

```bash
citydb info [OPTIONS]
```

## Options

The `info` command inherits global options from the main [`citydb`](cli.md) command. Additionally, it defines
report and output options.

### Global options

|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `-o`, <code>--output=&lt;file&#124;-&gt;</code> | Write output as a JSON file. Use `-` for `stdout`.                                                       |               |
| `--threads=<threads>`                           | Number of threads to use for parallel processing.                                                        |               |
| `-s`, `--feature-scope=<scope>`                 | Feature scope: `all`, `active`. For `active`, only properties of non-terminated features are considered. | `all`         |
| `--include-generic-attributes`                  | Include generic attributes and their data types.                                                         |               |

## Usage

### Generating a database report

A database report is generated by executing the `info` command with the connection details of the target 3DCityDB `v5`
instance.

=== "Linux"

    ```bash
    ./citydb info \
        -H localhost \
        -d citdb \
        -u citydb_user \
        -p mySecret
    ```

=== "Windows CMD"

    ```bat
    citydb info ^
        -H localhost ^
        -d citdb ^
        -u citydb_user ^
        -p mySecret
    ```

!!! note
    The time required to generate a report depends on the size of the database. Reports are generally much **faster to
    compute when indexes are enabled**. If indexes are disabled, report generation may take considerably longer. Use the
    [`index`](index-command.md) command to check the current status of indexes and enable them as needed.

The report is displayed on the console in a human-readable format. It can also be generated in machine-readable JSON
using the `--output` option. If a file path is provided for `--output`, the JSON output will be written to that file.
If `-` is specified instead of a file path, the JSON output will be written to `stdout`. This JSON output can be easily
piped to and processed by external tools.

The following examples demonstrate the usage of the `--output` option.

=== "Linux"

    ```bash
    ./citydb info [...] -o report.json      # write JSON to a file
    ./citydb info [...] -o -                # write JSON to stdout
    ./citydb info [...] -o - > report.json  # redirect stdout to a file
    ```

=== "Windows CMD"

    ```shell
    citydb info [...] -o report.json      # write JSON to a file
    citydb info [...] -o -                # write JSON to stdout
    citydb info [...] -o - > report.json  # redirect stdout to a file
    ```

### Report contents

The following example shows the structure of a JSON report generated by the `info` command. The human-readable version
of the report printed to the console contains the same information in a more concise form.

The JSON report is structured into sections, each summarizing a specific aspect of the database. The table below
provides an overview and description of these sections.

| Section       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `metadata`    | General information about the report, including the timestamp of generation, the scope of features considered, and whether generic attributes were processed.                                                 |
| `summary`     | High-level overview of the database content, including top-level feature types, available LoDs, appearance themes, CRS information, and spatial extent in both the database CRS and WGS84 coordinates.        |
| `database`    | Information about the connected database, including name and version, DBMS details including available extensions, 3DCityDB properties such as whether changelog tracking is enabled, and connection details. |
| `features`    | Counts of all features in the database, broken down into active vs. terminated, top-level features, and counts by feature type.                                                                               |
| `geometries`  | Statistics about geometries, including total count, count of implicit geometries, distribution by geometry type, and counts by LoD.                                                                           |
| `addresses`   | Total number of addresses stored in the database.                                                                                                                                                             |
| `appearances` | Detailed information about all appearances, including total number of appearances, presence of global appearances, materials, textures, georeferenced textures, and appearance counts broken down by theme.   |
| `extensions`  | List of all ADE extensions registered in the database, including name, version, and description. An empty array is shown if no extensions are available.                                                      |
| `codeLists`   | References to external codelists that are registered for appropriate CityGML data types in the database. An empty object is shown if no codelists are available.                                              |
| `modules`     | List of 3DCityDB module namespaces used by the data stored in the database.                                                                                                                                   |

### Feature scope

The `--feature-scope` option controls which features are considered when generating the report:

- `all`: Includes **all features** in the 3DCityDB, both active and terminated. All counts and derived statistics
  reflect the
  complete database. This is the default mode.

- `active`: Includes **only active features** when computing statistics and properties, ignoring terminated features. Overall
  feature counts still show both active and terminated features. Derived statistics—such as top-level features,
  available LoDs, and other feature-based properties—reflect only active features.

In databases containing both active and terminated features, the `active` scope produces a report that:

- Shows only statistics and properties derived from active features.
- Reflects what would be returned when exporting active features.
- Indicates which properties (e.g., LoDs or top-level feature types) can be used to filter active features.

For example, if a specific LoD exists only for terminated features, it will not appear in the report or be usable
for filtering active features. This makes the `active` scope useful for concise reports focused on current features, while
the `all` scope provides a complete overview of the database.

!!! note
    - Generating the report for only active features may take considerably more time.
    - For more information about terminating features, see the [`FEATURE`](../3dcitydb/feature-module.md#feature-table)
      table and the [`delete`](delete.md) command.

### Including generic attributes

The `--include-generic-attributes` option adds an additional `genericAttributes` section to the report.
This section lists all generic attributes present in the database together with their data types as defined
in the [`DATATYPE`](../3dcitydb/metadata-module.md#datatype-table) metadata table. Use this option when you need
a complete overview of the generic attributes available in the database.

The example below shows an excerpt of the `genericAttributes` section.

```json
{
  "metadata": {},
  "summary": {},
  ...
  "genericAttributes": {
    "ownerName": [
      "core:String"
    ],
    "roofHeight": [
      "core:Double"
    ],
    "energyPerformance": [ // (1)!
      "core:Integer",
      "core:String"
    ],
    ...
  }
}
```

1. In general, each generic attribute should be associated with a single data type. The presence of multiple data 
   types usually indicates a consistency issue.

!!! note
    Depending on the number and complexity of generic attributes, generating the report may take more time.

### Including database size metrics

Enabling the `--include-size-metrics` option appends a `size` subsection to the `database` section of the report. This
subsection contains size values in bytes for the entire database, the selected schema, and individual tables. An example
is shown below.

```json
{
  "metadata": {},
  "summary": {},
  ...
  "database":{
    "name":"3D City Database",
    "version":"5.1.0",
    ...
    "size":{
      "databaseSize":21454392467,
      "schemaSize":21436571648,
      "byTable":{
        "address":54951936,
        "appear_to_surface_data":2442379264,
        "appearance":283295744,
        "feature":3317882880,
        "geometry_data":2525831168,
        "implicit_geometry":32768,
        "property":6379757568,
        "surface_data":1938014208,
        "surface_data_mapping":3295518720,
        "tex_image":1198391296
      }
    }
  }
}
```

!!! tip
    This option allows you to quickly evaluate the storage footprint of a 3DCityDB `v5` instance and its tables, which
    can be helpful for performance analysis, monitoring growth, or planning backups.

### Controlling the report process

The `info` command offers the following options to control the export process:

- `--threads`: Sets the number of threads for parallel processing to improve performance. By default, four threads
  are used independent of the number of processors available to the JVM.

!!! note
    Setting the number of threads too high can lead to performance issues due to thrashing. Additionally, each thread
    requires a separate database connection, so ensure your database can handle the required number of connections.
