# Import CityGML command

The `import citygml` command imports one or more [CityGML files](https://www.ogc.org/publications/standard/citygml/)
into the 3DCityDB `v5`.

## Synopsis

```bash
citydb import citygml [OPTIONS] <file>...
```

## Options

The `import citygml` command inherits global options from the main [`citydb`](cli.md) command and general import,
metadata, and filter options from its parent [`import`](import.md) command. Additionally, it provides CityGML
format-specific import options.

## Usage

!!! tip
    For general usage hints applicable to all subcommands of the `import` command (including but not limited to
    `import citygml`), refer to the documentation for the `import` command [here](import.md#usage).

### Supported CityGML versions

The `import citygml` command supports importing CityGML files in versions 3.0, 2.0, and 1.0. It recognizes the following
file types and extensions:

| File type            | File extensions |
|----------------------|-----------------|
| CityGML file         | `.gml`, `.xml`  |
| GZIP compressed file | `.gz`, `.gzip`  |
| ZIP archive          | `.zip`          |

The file extensions are used when a directory or ZIP archive is provided as `<file>` input instead of a single file.
In such cases, the directory or archive is recursively scanned for input files, which are identified using the
extensions listed above and then processed for import.

### Upgrading CityGML 2.0 and 1.0

CityGML data can be exported from the 3DCityDB `v5` in the same version as it was imported, without loss. However,
switching CityGML versions between import and export may result in data loss, as CityGML 3.0 is not fully backward
compatible with versions 2.0 and 1.0. While citydb-tool applies automatic conversions where possible, certain
scenarios require user input.

If CityGML 3.0 is the primary format for your 3DCityDB `v5` instance, the following upgrade options are
available to resolve compatibility issues when importing CityGML 2.0 or 1.0 files:

- `--use-lod4-as-lod3`: Converts LoD4 geometries to LoD3, replacing any existing LoD3.
- `--map-lod0-roof-edge`: Converts LoD0 roof edge geometries into roof surface features.
- `--map-lod1-surface`: Converts LoD1 multi-surfaces into generic thematic surface features.

!!! note
    The upgrade options are not required if you only manage CityGML 2.0 and 1.0 data in your 3DCityDB `v5`.
    However, be cautious when importing CityGML 3.0 in this setup, as citydb-tool does not offer downgrade options. Any
    CityGML 3.0 content that cannot be automatically downgraded when exporting to CityGML 2.0 or 1.0 will be skipped.
    For more details, refer to the [compatibility and data migration](../compatibility.md) guide.

### Filtering CityGML features

The `import citygml` command inherits [filtering options](import.md#filtering-features) from the parent `import`
command. In the context of CityGML input files, the filters operate as follows:

| Filter                                                               | Description                                                |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Feature identifier filter](import.md#feature-identifier-filter) | Applies to the `gml:id` property of input features.        |
| [Bounding box filter](import.md#bounding-box-filter)             | Applies to the `gml:boundedBy` property of input features. |

!!! note
    Filters are applied to the top-level `<cityObjectMember>` elements in the input file. Matching features
    are imported, including all their subfeatures. Filtering subfeatures is not supported.

### Filtering appearances

By default, the `import citygml` command imports all appearance information from the input files. The
`--appearance-theme` option restricts the import of appearances based on their `<theme>` property. You can specify one
or more themes as a comma-separated list. To filter appearances that have no theme property, use `none` as the value.

Only appearances associated with the specified themes will be imported. To exclude all appearances from the import, use
the `--no-appearances` option.

### Applying XSL transformations

XSLT stylesheets enable the on-the-fly transformation of CityGML input data before it is imported into the database.
This allows you to modify or restructure the data to meet specific needs, such as changing values, filtering attributes,
or removing and replacing entire GML/XML structures.

The `--xsl-transform` option specifies one or more XSLT stylesheets to be applied to the input files. Each stylesheet must
be referenced by its filename and path, which can be either absolute or relative to the current directory. Multiple XSLT
stylesheets can be listed, separated by commas, to facilitate a multi-step transformation process. In this case, the
stylesheets are executed in the specified order, with the output of one stylesheet serving as the input for the next.

=== "Linux"

    ```bash
    ./citydb import citygml [...] my-city.gml \
        --xsl-transform=my-first-stylesheet.xsl,my-second-stylesheet.xsl
    ```

=== "Windows CMD"

    ```bat
    citydb import citygml [...] my-city.gml ^
        --xsl-transform=my-first-stylesheet.xsl,my-second-stylesheet.xsl
    ```

!!! note
    - To handle large input files, citydb-tool chunks each CityGML file into top-level features, which are then imported
      into the database. As a result, each XSLT stylesheet operates on individual top-level features, not the entire file.
      Keep this in mind when developing your XSLT.
    - The output of each XSLT stylesheet must be valid CityGML.

### Storing xAL address elements

CityGML uses the [OASIS Extensible Address Language (xAL)](https://docs.oasis-open.org/ciq/v3.0/specs/ciq-specs-v3.html)
standard to encode address data. During import, citydb-tool parses the xAL content and maps it to the separate columns
of the [`ADDRESS`](../3dcitydb/feature-module.md#address-table) table, which provides a comprehensive and flexible
structure for storing address data. However, if the original xAL address element is too complex to be fully mapped to
the `ADDRESS` table columns, the `--import-xal-source` option allows importing and retaining the original xAL element.
For more details, see [here](../3dcitydb/feature-module.md#address-table).
