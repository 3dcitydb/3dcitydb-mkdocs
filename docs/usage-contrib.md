This documentation is made with [`mkdocs`](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and [`mkdocs-material`](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material). On this page you will find instructions on how to work effectively with the documentation and how to contribute.

### Search and page navigation

The most efficient way to find things in the documentation is to use the search function. In many cases, just one keyword will be enough to find the right page. You can access the search function using the search bar at the top or keyboard shortcuts.

#### Keyboard shortcuts

The [search function](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/plugins/search/){target="_blank"} can be conveniently controlled via the keyboard. The same applies to navigation between pages. There are two modes for the search function:

: This mode is active when the _search bar is focused_. It offers several keys to make the search accessible and navigable via the keyboard:

    * ++arrow-down++ , ++arrow-up++ : Select next/previous search result
    * ++esc++ , ++tab++ : Close search dialog
    * ++enter++ : Open search result

: This mode is active when _search bar is not focused_ and when there is no other focused element that is receptive to keyboard input. The following keys are bound:

    * ++f++ , ++s++ , ++slash++ : Open search dialog
    * ++p++ , ++comma++ : Next page
    * ++n++ , ++period++ : Previous page

See [here](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-navigation/?h=keyboard#keyboard-shortcuts){target="blank"} for more information on creating your own key combinations.

## How to contribute
