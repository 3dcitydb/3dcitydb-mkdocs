The [Chair of Geoinformatics](https://www.asg.ed.tum.de/en/gis/){target="blank"} belongs to the [Department of Aerospace and Geodesy](https://www.asg.ed.tum.de/asg/){target="blank"} within the [TUM School of Engineering and Design](https://www.ed.tum.de/){target="blank"} at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de){target="blank"}. TUM is the highest ranked German university and internationally among the top 30 universities. 

Research topics of the Chair of Geoinformatics (TUMGIS) cover Urban Digital Twinning and Smart Cities, Semantic 3D City and Landscape Modeling, multi-modal navigation and autonomous driving, spatial data infrastructures, 3D spatial databases and algorithms, AI in geoinformatics. We are active member of the Open Geospatial Consortium and have driven and/or contributed to the creation of the international standards CityGML, IndoorGML, 3D Portrayal Service. A number of current and former members of TUMGIS have contributed or are currently contributing to the development of the 3DCityDB: Zhihang Yao, Kanishk Chaturvedi, Son H. Nguyen, Bruno Willenborg, Murat Kendir, Andreas Donaubauer.

Besides the 3DCityDB, TUMGIS also released many more Open Source projects (>130) which can be found on the Github repository of our group: [https://github.com/tum-gis](https://github.com/tum-gis){target="blank"}.

## 3DCityDB usage in research and education

The 3DCityDB has always been an important tool within our research activities around semantic 3D city models, CityGML, and spatial databases as well for education. It is employed, for example, in different courses as well as in student projects and theses in our international master's programs

## Your contact: Thomas H. Kolbe

![Thomas H. Kolbe](assets/thkolbe.jpg){ align="right" width="250"} [Thomas H. Kolbe is Full Professor and Chair of Geoinformatics](https://www.asg.ed.tum.de/en/gis/our-team/staff/prof-thomas-h-kolbe/){target="blank"} at Technical University of Munich, Germany. His interests are in GIScience, specifically in the fields of virtual 3D city, landscape, and building information modelling. Prof. Kolbe is initiator and one of the principal developers of the CityGML standard for urban information modelling and the interoperable exchange of semantic 3D city models in the Open Geospatial Consortium. He has also been architect in the development of the OGC IndoorGML standard for indoor navigation. 

Prof. Kolbe started and led the development of the 3DCityDB project since his time as PostDoc and senior research assistant at the University of Bonn in the group of Prof. Lutz Pl√ºmer back in 2003. Over the many development cycles more partners got on board and now the development of the 3DCityDB is carried out in a collaborative way by the different development partners.
