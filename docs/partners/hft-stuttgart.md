The [Hochschule für Technik Stuttgart (HFT Stuttgart)](https://www.hft-stuttgart.de/)
is one of the strong research universities of applied sciences in Germany with successful national,
European and worldwide research projects.
This strength is reflected in its two key research thrusts, which have been officially certified
according to the formal criteria established by the German Rectors' Conference (HRK) and included
in the [HRK’s Research Map](https://www.forschungslandkarte.de/profilbildende-forschung-an-fachhochschulen/kartensuche/)

- Future-oriented Planning, Constructing and Managing
- Smart Cities and Urban Development

As a leading university of applied sciences in Digital Twin and Smart City research,
HFT Stuttgart collaborates closely with industry, government agencies, and international research institutions to
develop innovative technologies that pave the way for the development of modern, sustainable, and smart cities.

After Prof. Zhihang Yao took over the professorship at HFT Stuttgart in 2024, HFT Stuttgart
officially becomes a new cooperation partner of the 3DCityDB project.
HFT Stuttgart will actively contribute to the ongoing development of 3DCityDB and integrate
it more extensively into its teaching activities and research projects.

Prof. Zhihang Yao specializes in 3D geoinformation, spatial data infrastructure, and digital urban modeling.
He began his PhD at TUMGI and joined the 3DCityDB team, where he became one of the lead developers and maintainers
of the 3DCityDB software, with a particular focus on the 3DCityDB Web Map Client.
This tool received the annual award of the joint "3D City Modeling Commission" of the German Society for
Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing, and Geoinformation (DGPF) and the German Society for Cartography (DGfK) in 2015.
His current research focuses on advancing CityGML-based 3D-geodatabases and their applications in urban planning,
smart cities, and geospatial analytics.
